## Breadth First Search Summary

### 1. When to Use BFS

- Graph traversal (tree is also graph)
  - level order traversal
  - connected component
  - topological sorting
- Shortest path in simple graph (equal weights edges)

### 2. BFS in Binary Tree

### 3. BFS in Graph

### 4. BFS in Matrix

### 5. BFS Time Complexity



#### X. Tips and Notice

- Queue structure is used for BFS, queue is "first in first out".
- In python, queue structure is `collections.deque`, dequeue method is `.popleft()`. Python `list` is **stack**, therefore `.pop(0)` is `O(n)`.
